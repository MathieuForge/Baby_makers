Who are the Baby Markers
Description
"Who are the Baby Markers" is a data analysis project aimed at exploring the impact of victories in major sporting competitions on various socio-economic indicators of a country, such as birth rates, employment rates, CO2 levels, and GDP. Utilizing a unique indicator named "fervor," calculated based on the number of victories, goals in a tournament, and adjusted for host countries, we investigated the existing correlations between sports performance and these indicators. The project also includes a prediction algorithm to forecast the winners of future competitions and the potential impact of these victories on the mentioned indicators. An intriguing aspect of our research is analyzing the relationship between sports victories and the popularity of names post-victory.
